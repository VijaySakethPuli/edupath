# EduPathAI — One‑Stop Personalized Career & Education Advisor

EduPathAI helps students move from “confusion after Class 10/12” to a clear, local, and actionable pathway: assess strengths, pick the right stream, discover matching careers, and apply to nearby government colleges with live admission and scholarship timelines. Built for Smart India Hackathon 2025, Problem Statement 25094.

## Why this matters
- Guidance gap, not infrastructure, drives low enrolment in government colleges.
- Information is fragmented: aptitude/interest, courses, careers, exams, scholarships, and local colleges live in different silos.
- Families need explainable, localized recommendations and reminders that convert intent into enrolment.

## What EduPathAI does
- 5‑minute aptitude + interest assessment for Class 10/12 students.
- AI‑backed recommendations that map streams to careers, relevant exams, and higher‑study routes.
- Location‑aware directory of nearby government colleges with programs, eligibility, medium, and facilities.
- Timeline tracker for admissions and scholarships with reminders.
- Offline‑first experience tailored for low bandwidth.

## Key features
- Hyper‑local guidance: stream/career mapping tied to nearby government colleges and seats.
- Explainable recommendations: fit scores with clear reasons for trust by parents/teachers.
- End‑to‑end flow: Assessment → Streams → Careers → Colleges → Applications → Reminders.
- Government‑first design: defaults to public institutions, scholarships, and exams.
- Low‑bandwidth ready: lightweight UI, caching, and graceful fallbacks.

## Architecture (high level)
- Frontend: Next.js (web), Tailwind CSS, optional React Native (mobile).
- Backend: Node.js/Express REST API for assessments, recommendations routing, timelines.
- AI service: Python/FastAPI recommendation logic with transparent rules/fallbacks.
- Data: MongoDB (profiles), PostgreSQL (structured college/program/timeline data).
- Offline: caching layers for quiz, recommendations, and college listings.
- Auth: JWT-based sessions (if enabled for counselor dashboards).

## Local development

Prerequisites
- Node.js LTS, npm or pnpm
- Python 3.10+ (for AI service, if running locally)
- MongoDB and PostgreSQL (local or managed)

Clone and savepoint
- git clone https://github.com/VijaySakethPuli/edupath.git
- cd edupathai-platform
- git checkout -b feature/dev
- Make a savepoint later with: git tag -a v0.1-savepoint -m "Stable checkpoint"; git push origin v0.1-savepoint

Environment variables
Create two files:

frontend/.env.local
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

backend/.env
- PORT=3001
- MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/edupathai
- POSTGRES_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/edupathai
- AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000

Install and run

Frontend
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev
- App: http://localhost:3000

Backend
- cd backend
- npm install
- npm run dev
- API: http://localhost:3001/api
  - GET /recommendations/health
  - POST /assessment/submit
  - POST /recommendations
  - POST /recommendations/streams
  - POST /recommendations/careers

AI service (optional if using rules fallback)
- cd ai
- python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
- Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Testing the flow

- Open http://localhost:3000/assess
- Complete quiz and click “See Summary” to generate recommendations.
- Visit http://localhost:3000/streams and http://localhost:3000/careers to view personalized results.
- If needed, test backend with curl or Postman:
  - curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/recommendations/streams -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"interests\":{\"I1\":4},\"aptitude\":{\"0\":1},\"class_level\":12}"

## Project structure (monorepo example)

- frontend/ — Next.js app
  - src/pages/assess.js — assessment + submit + summary
  - src/pages/streams.js — Explore Streams wired to API
  - src/pages/careers.js — Careers view
  - src/context/RecommendationContext.js — assessment & recommendations state
- backend/ — Node/Express API
  - server.js — routes mounting, CORS, health
  - routes/recommendations.js — recommendations endpoints
  - routes/assessment.js — assessment submission
- ai/ — Python/FastAPI (optional)
  - app.py — recommendation endpoints and models
- data/ — seeds/snapshots for AISHE/NIRF integrations (optional)

## Data and roadmap

Current
- Quiz-driven recommendations with explainable reasons and fit scores.
- College finder scaffold, timeline tracker scaffold.

Planned integrations
- AISHE datasets for institution/program metadata.
- NIRF data for contextual rankings and filters.
- State portals for admissions/scholarships sync.
- Counselor dashboard for schools and district analytics.
- Multilingual UI and voice support.

## Security & privacy

- Minimal PII; consent-based profile creation.
- Client-only public env vars prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_.
- JWT for authenticated flows (counselors/admin).
- CORS restricted to frontend origins in deployment.

## Troubleshooting

- 404 on /streams or /careers: ensure pages exist and frontend dev server is restarted.
- Context shows null on /streams after assessment:
  - Confirm submit logs run in console.
  - Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is set and the frontend server was restarted after editing env.
  - Hydrate from localStorage as fallback on mount.
- “Identifier already declared” in backend:
  - Remove duplicate require/app.use mounts for the same route.
- Don’t commit node_modules:
  - Add node_modules/ to .gitignore, run git rm -r --cached node_modules, commit again.

## Contributing

- Branch from main using feature/<name>.
- Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots/demo steps.
- Use conventional commits if possible (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:).

## License

- Add your preferred license (e.g., MIT) as LICENSE in repo root.
